# Dive
Data Integration and Virtualized Efficiency
# Description
This project falls within the field of computer systems, specifically focusing on centralized and virtualized systems. 
Its primary objective is to optimize network communication flows and enhance storage performance. 
The first step involves conducting a literature review and evaluating existing research on optimization mechanisms for communication flows.
More specifically, we will evaluate AccelTCP(https://github.com/acceltcp/AccelTCP) and work on making it compatible with XDP offload in network drivers.
